      "'Interest Rate Stabilization and the Allocation of Liquidity (Job market paper)\n",
      "This paper studies liquidity provision in an economy with decentralized intermediation and studies the\n",
      "potential role of monetary policy in improving its efficiency. Consumers and firms obtain liquid funds from\n",
      "banks, while banks obtain funds from other banks in the money market. Financial markets are incomplete\n",
      "because bank-specific liquidity shocks are unobservable and because banks cannot monitor each other's\n",
      "balance sheets. With incomplete financial markets the competitive equilibrium is constrained inefficient. The\n",
      "direction of the inefficiency is that banks extend too large credit lines and tend to be illiquid on the money\n",
      "market. This generates excess interest rate volatility and provides a rationale for interest rate stabilization.\n",
      "Introducing a nominal friction (deposits denominated in dollars), a central bank can intervene to stabilize the\n",
      "interest rate. In the spirit of Poole's analysis I show that when the source of the shocks is purely\n",
      "technological, interest rate stabilization is less desirable than when the source of the shocks is mainly\n",
      "liquidity driven. Also, the desirability of interest rate stabilization is greater when bank-specific shocks are\n",
      "large and when the banking system is more decentralized. In the last part of the paper I endogenize the\n",
      "structure of the banking system and show that it is not necessarily the case that a more centralized banking\n",
      "system is superior to a decentralized one. This happens because banks with access to internal sources of\n",
      "liquidity may have a destabilizing effect on the money market.\n",
      "'Household Wealth and Consumption Variability\n",
      "This paper studies the empirical relevance of precautionary savings looking at the relationship between\n",
      "household financial wealth and the variability of consumption. Models of precautionary savings predict that\n",
      "when accumulated wealth is large enough it will be used to reduce the variability of consumption against\n",
      "income and non-income shocks. When the Euler equation holds, this variability coincides with the second\n",
      "moment of the Euler equation residual . Using PSID data, the paper offers both parametric and non-\n",
      "parametric evidence of a monotone decreasing relation between the level of household wealth and the\n",
      "variability of marginal utility in the immediate future, which can be taken as indirect evidence in favor of the\n",
      "precautionary motive. The results extend those of Zeldes (1989) on liquidity constraints. Zeldes\n",
      "concentrates on the conditional first moment of the Euler equation residual; here I study the conditional\n",
      "GUIDO LORENZONI\n",
      "second moment of the Euler equation residual, which is expected to be smoothly decreasing over a range of\n",
      "wealth levels. These results can also be interpreted as a test of the full insurance model against the specific\n",
      "alternative hypothesis of self-insurance. A by-product of this analysis is the study of an identification\n",
      "problem that arises with the log-linearized version of the Euler equation. If the residuals are conditionally\n",
      "heteroskedastic with respect to the instruments, the traditional linearized model is incorrectly identified. In\n",

      "previous econometrics courses, and that you are able to utilize Stata help files to learn new\n",

      "consumer of research findings. It is healthy to approach articles as though the basic claims\n",
      "being stated are wrong, and to think of ways to debunk the claims being made.\n",
      "The assignment asks you to write a 1-2 page memo assessing the findings of a recent program\n",
      "evaluation study. This should consist of a concise summary and critique of a study reported on\n",
      "in popular press (e.g., New York Times, Washington Post, or the Wall Street Journal). This\n",

      "design of the study, findings from the study, and critique. The first three sections should be\n",
      "very short (half a page to a page).  The majority of the memo should focus on the weaknesses of\n",

      "Course presentation: You will each formally discuss a small number of papers. There will be\n",
      "two formal discussants per paper. The formal discussant remarks should resemble those at\n",
      "academic conferences, and we will discuss what this means in on July 20. Discussant remarks\n",
      "should last no more than 15 minutes per discussant. Following the formal discussant remarks,\n",
      "there will be a (guided as lightly as possible) discussion of the paper.\n",
      "It is advisable that you start preparing for the formal discussant remarks well in advance, in\n",
      "case you have questions about the economics or the econometrics of the paper you are\n",
      "assigned to discuss. Practicing your formal discussant remarks is also a good idea. You can send\n",
